        <mark><b>MY DAILY LIFE</b></mark>
        <br>
        Just like every other kids, i go to <mark><i><b>school</b></i></mark> every day.
        But <b>everyday is different</b>. 
        <br>
        Usually i wake up at <b>6.20</b> and do my morning routine. Which includes putting on my uniforms, eating my breskfast and so on. Then i go outside and wait for my school bus which arrives at <b>7 am</b>. 
        <br>
        School starts at <b>8 am</b> and usually i have 8 classes.
        Our school has <b>after-school programm</b>. I go to <mark>volleyball</mark>, <mark>debating club</mark> and <mark>MUN</mark> there.
        <br>
        Finally I'm home, usually at <b>6.30</b>. Then I do my HW. Mostly, I'm done with my HW at <b>9.30</b>. Next I sleep - of course at <b>10 pm or 10.30</b>.
        <br>
        <strong>Thank You.</strong>
